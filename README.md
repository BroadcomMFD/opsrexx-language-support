The OPS/REXX language is a crucial part of the Broadcom OPS/MVSÂ® product that adds to standard REXX a set of extensions to automate and enhance the productivity of z/OS operations. With the OPS/REXX Language Support extension, automation engineers can develop OPS/MVS Automated Operations Facility (AOF) rules and OPS/REXX programs more efficiently by editing OPS/REXX in a local VS Code environment.


## Key Features
OPS/REXX Language Support makes AOF rule and OPS/REXX program development easier by enabling you to

- Use OPS/REXX syntax highlighting to help distinguish the elements of AOF rules and OPS/REXX programs
- Use autocompletion for names of OPS/REXX built-in functions, host environments, and AOF event variables
- Get hover help on OPS/REXX built-in functions, host environment names, and AOF event variable names
- Get basic error checking for AOF rule and OPS/REXX syntax
- Copy from a library of frequently used OPS/REXX rule snippets
- Issue selected OPS/MVS commands


The OPS/REXX Language Support extension does _not_ provide the ability for you to download from, upload to, or submit jobs on the mainframe. To access mainframe code while using OPS/REXX Language Support, we recommend Zowe Explorer (see [Recommended Software](#recommended-software)) or Zowe CLI.

## Recommended Software
The OPS/REXX Language Support extension has no prerequisite software. However, for your best experience with OPS/REXX Language Support, we recommend the following software.

### REXX Language Support Extension
For correct display of syntax highlighting, we recommend using OPS/REXX Language Support with a REXX language support extension. OPS/REXX Language Support has been tested for compatibility with the [Broadcom REXX Language Support extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.lsp-for-rexx).

### Zowe Explorer
We recommend using Zowe Explorer to access mainframe code while using OPS/REXX Language Support. For more information about the Zowe Explorer extension, see [Zowe Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe) on the VS Code marketplace.

## Using OPS/REXX Language Support with OPS/MVS
Although it is possible to use OPS/REXX Language Support without access to OPS/MVS, most users will want to use the extension while interacting with an OPS/MVS instance. To use OPS/REXX Language Support with OPS/MVS:

1. Ensure that your instance of OPS/MVS is configured with _one_ of the following components:

   - The REST API (OPSREST) 
   - RESTful Web Services (OPSWS)

2. In the OPS/REXX Language Support extension settings, specify the following parameters:
   
    **REST API**
     - If you are using the extension with the OPS/MVS REST API, activate the check box to set the value of this parameter to `true`.
     - If you are using the extension with OPS/MVS RESTful Web Services, deactivate the check box to set the value of this parameter to `false`.
   
    **Rule Set**
  
     Specify the default working rule set for the OPS/MVS instance you are using.
      
    **Subsystem**
   
     Specify the default subsystem for the OPS/MVS instance you are using.

3. Create a team configuration file containing the connection information for the OPS/MVS instance you would like to connect to. Use _one_ of the following methods:

   - [Use Zowe Explorer](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/ze-profiles) to create a team configuration file.  Provide the following information:
   
     - The host name of the LPAR on which the REST API or RESTful Web Services is running.
     - The port number for the REST API or RESTful Web Services.
     - A username that has authority to access the REST API or RESTful Web Services.
     - The password to the account that is associated with the username.
    
   - Follow [these steps](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-mainframe-software/devops/enterprise-support-for-zowe/1-0/using/zowe-cli/available-cli-plug-ins/ca-ops-mvs-plug-in-for-zowe-cli.html) to manually create a team configuration file.
    
4. When working with OPS/REXX files, ensure their file extension is `.opsrexx` to automatically enable OPS/REXX Language Support Extension features. For more information, see [Configuring for Zowe Explorer](#configuring-for-zowe-explorer-recommended).

### Using OPS/REXX Language Support with multiple OPS/MVS instances
- If you are using the extension with multiple OPS/MVS instances running on different systems, install and configure OPS/MVS RESTful Web Services or the OPS/MVS REST API on each system in your OPSplex. One instance of RESTful Web Services or the REST API is required for each system.
- When you have multiple instances of OPS/MVS running on a single system, only one instance of RESTful Web Services or the REST API is required.
   
## Configuring for Zowe Explorer (Recommended)
To ensure that data sets accessed through Zowe Explorer are recognized by the extension as **.opsrexx** files, you must create a file association in your VS Code settings.

To create a file association, use one of the following options.

**Option 1: Create a file association in Workspace Settings**     
1. Use the command palette in VS Code (**Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P**) to locate the Workspace Settings.
2. Scroll down to the **Files: Associations** setting and click **Add Item**.
3. Add `*.REXX(*` to the **Key** field, and `opsrexx` to the **Value** field.
4. Add `*.RULES(*` to the **Key** field, and `opsrexx` to the **Value** field.

**Option 2: Create a file association in User Settings**
1. Use the command palette in VS Code (**Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P**) to locate the file `settings.json` (User Settings).
2. In `settings.json`, add the lines `"*.REXX(*": "opsrexx"` and `"*.RULES(*": "opsrexx"` under `"files.associations"` as shown in the following example:
  
      ```
          "files.associations": {
              "*.REXX(*": "opsrexx",
              "*.RULES(*": "opsrexx",
          },
      ``` 

After completing the steps for either of the two options, you can use Zowe Explorer to access `.opsrexx` files.

## Using OPS/REXX Language Support

### OPS/REXX Syntax Highlighting
Use OPS/REXX syntax highlighting and symbol resolution to help you avoid syntax errors when developing rules.

### OPS/REXX Hover Insights
Place and hold your cursor over an OPS/REXX element to view more information about it. Hover insights are available for OPS/REXX built-in functions, host environments, or AOF event variable names.

![Hover Insights](docs/images/gifs/hover.gif)

### Variable Autocompletion
To trigger autocompletion of AOF variables, type `.` after an AOF rule type stem, such as `msg.`.
AOF variable completions are supported for all rule types.

![AOF Variable Completion](docs/images/gifs/stem-var-completion.gif)

Variable autocompletion is triggered automatically when you type an OPS/REXX built-in function or host environment name.

![Function and Host Env Completion](docs/images/gifs/basic-completion.gif)

### Syntax Error Checking
OPS/REXX Language Support automatically performs some basic error checks on AOF rule and OPS/REXX program syntax, such as the line length warning shown in the following image.

![Syntax Error Checking](docs/images/line-too-long-error.PNG)

### Using OPS/REXX Snippets
Before you write AOF rules from scratch, check the snippet library for any applicable rule snippets.
To use the snippet library:

1. Open the VS Code command palette by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`.
2. Type `Insert Snippet`.
3. Click the command or press Enter.
4. Choose the type of rule snippet you want to insert.
5. Fill in the templated values to complete the OPS/REXX rule.

![Snippets](docs/images/gifs/function-cmd.gif)


For a quicker way to access the snippets:

1. Begin typing the name of a snippet (such as `)MSG`) in the editor.
 
   VS Code autocomplete suggests the full name of the snippet.
 
2. Select the suggested snippet and press Enter.

![Snippets](docs/images/gifs/snippet.gif)

Using snippets promotes consistent and correct syntax in the rules you design.

### Issuing OPS/MVS Commands
To issue OPS/MVS commands through OPS/REXX Language Support, you need an OPS/MVS RESTful Web Services or REST API connection. Configure the OPS/REXX Language Support extension for the connection as described in [Using OPS/REXX Language Support with OPS/MVS](#using-opsrexx-language-support-with-opsmvs).
 
If you are using Zowe Explorer (optional) to issue commands, configure the extension as described in [Configuring for Zowe Explorer](#configuring-for-zowe-explorer-recommended).

You can use OPS/REXX Language Support to issue the following OPS/MVS commands:

  - `Show Rule Status` - Shows the status of a selected rule.   
  - `Enable Rule` - Enables a selected rule.
  - `Disable Rule` - Disables a selected rule.

To issue OPS/MVS commands, use one of the following methods.

#### Option 1
1. In the File Explorer sidebar of the VS Code application window, browse for and open the file containing the rule you want.
2. Type `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` to open the VS Code command palette.
3. Select the command you want from the menu: **OPS/MVS: Show Rule Status**, **OPS/MVS: Enable Rule**, or **OPS/MVS: Disable Rule**. 

#### Option 2
1. In the File Explorer sidebar of the VS Code application window, right-click on the icon representing the rule you want.
2. From the pop-up menu, select the command you want: **OPS/MVS: Show Rule Status**, **OPS/MVS: Enable Rule**, or **OPS/MVS: Disable Rule**.
  
After the command is issued, the VS Code window displays a status message. 
  
  - If the `Show Rule Status` command succeeds, the rule status displays (`ENABLED` or `DISABLED`).
    
  - If the `Enable Rule` command succeeds, the original status (`DISABLED`) displays, followed by the new status (`ENABLED`).
    
  - If the `Disable Rule` command succeeds, the original status (`ENABLED`) displays, followed by the new status (`DISABLED`).
    
  - If a command fails, an error message or the message `NOT FOUND` displays.
 
 **Tip:** If you are using OPS/REXX Language Support with Zowe Explorer, you can use option 1 or option 2 from the Zowe Explorer sidebar in the VS Code application window. See the following videos for demonstrations.
